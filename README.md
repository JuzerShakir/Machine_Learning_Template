### Data

#### Files

This project contains x files and y folder:

- `result.ipynb`: This is the main file where I have performed my work on the project.
- `result.csv`: The project dataset. I have loaded this data in the notebook..
- `export/` : Folder containing HTML and PDF version file of notebook.
- `x` : Y
- `x` : Y

#### Dataset file
"Explain the dataset file that contains the data for prediction."

### Loading Project

#### Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/)      (Language Used for the project)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)                                            (For Scientific Computing)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)                                        (For Data Analysis)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)                                      (For Visualization)   
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)                     (For Visualization)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)                           (ML Library for Python)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### Execution

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `____` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook report.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter/iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
