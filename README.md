#### Files

This project contains x files and y folder:

- `report.ipynb`: This is the main file where I have performed my work on the project.
- `data.csv`: The project dataset. I have loaded this data in the notebook..
- `export/` : Folder containing HTML and PDF version file of notebook.
- `plots/` : Contains images of all the plots that are displayed in `report.ipynb` file.

#### Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)       (_Language Used for the project_)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)                                            (_For Scientific Computing_)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)                                        (_For Data Analysis_)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)                                      (_For Visualization_)   
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)                     (_For Visualization_)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)                           (_ML Library for training & testing data_)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)                (_ML Library for Deep Learning_)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### Execution

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `____` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook report.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
```
or if you have 'Jupyter Lab' installed
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter/iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
